# Google Drive MCP Server

Google Drive MCP Server is a stateless server that integrates Google Drive functionalities with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a suite of tools and resources to interact with Google Drive, enabling operations like file management, content retrieval, and permission handling through a standardized interface.

üöÄ **Features**

* **Drive Roots Listing:** Retrieve files from "My Drive" and "Shared with me" sections.
* **Folder Contents:** List all items within a specified folder.
* **File Metadata Retrieval:** Access detailed metadata of files.
* **Content Exporting:** Export Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides to formats like Markdown, CSV, or plain text.
* **File Upload & Update:** Upload new files or update existing ones with base64-encoded content.
* **Text Appending:** Append plain text to existing text files.
* **File Deletion:** Trash or permanently delete files.
* **Permission Management:** Share files with specific users, groups, domains, or publicly.
* **Commenting:** Add comments to files.
* **Change Tracking:** Monitor changes in Drive using change tokens.
* **File Searching:** Search for files based on name substrings.

üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rishipradeep-think41/google-drive-mcp.git](https://github.com/rishipradeep-think41/google-drive-mcp.git)
    cd google-drive-mcp
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```env
    CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token
    PORT=8081
    ```
    Ensure you have a valid Google OAuth2 client and refresh token with appropriate Drive API scopes.

4.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8081`.
