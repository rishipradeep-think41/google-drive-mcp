# Google Drive MCP Server

Google Drive MCP Server is a stateless server that integrates Google Drive functionalities with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a suite of tools and resources to interact with Google Drive, enabling operations like file management, content retrieval, and permission handling through a standardized interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Root Listing:** List top-level locations like "My Drive" and "Shared with me" using `drive_roots`.
- **Folder Browsing:** List contents of any folder with `drive_folder_children`.
- **File Metadata:** Retrieve detailed metadata for a file using `drive_file_metadata`.
- **File Exporting:** Retrieve raw file content using `drive_file_content` (note: no built-in format conversion).
- **File Uploading:** Create or update files with content using `drive_upload`.
- **Text Appending:** Append plain text to existing text files using `drive_append_text`.
- **File Deletion & Trash:** Move files to trash or delete them permanently with `drive_delete` and `drive_file_empty_trash`.
- **Permission Management:** Add, update, remove, or list permissions for files/folders via `drive_share`, `drive_permission_update`, `drive_permission_delete`, etc.
- **Commenting & Replies:** Add comments, reply to them, and list/delete comments or replies using tools like `drive_comment`, `drive_file_list_comments`, and related tools.
- **Change Tracking:** Track changes in a user's Drive using `drive_changes`.
- **File Search:** Search for files by name or other criteria using `drive_search`.

üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    git clone [https://github.com/rishipradeep-think41/google-drive-mcp.git](https://github.com/rishipradeep-think41/google-drive-mcp.git)
    cd google-drive-mcp
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```env
    CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token
